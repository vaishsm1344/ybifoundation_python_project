# Explanation of Restaurant Ordering System Code

This Python script simulates a basic ordering system for a restaurant where users can order items from a predefined menu. The code allows users to choose from a list of food and drink items and calculates the total cost of their order.

### Key Features:
1. **Menu**: A dictionary that contains food and drink items along with their respective prices.
2. **User Interaction**: The program greets the user and displays the menu. The user is then prompted to make a selection.
3. **Order Total**: The cost of the items ordered is accumulated to compute the total order price.
4. **Multiple Orders**: The user can order multiple items, and the script allows for additional items to be added after the initial order.
5. **Final Price**: After the user completes their order, the total price is displayed along with a thank-you message.

### Code Breakdown:

1. **Menu Definition**:
    ```python
    menu = {
        'Pizza': 40,
        'Pasta': 35,
        'Burger': 50,
        'Salad': 25,
        'Coffee': 30,
    }
    ```
    A dictionary `menu` is created with keys representing the names of the items and values representing their corresponding prices.

2. **Greeting the User**:
    ```python
    print("Welcome to HideOut Restaurant")
    print("Pizza: Rs40\nPasta: Rs35\nBurger: Rs50\nSalad: Rs25\nCoffee: Rs30")
    ```
    The script greets the user with a welcome message and displays the menu items and their prices.

3. **Initializing Order Total**:
    ```python
    order_total = 0
    ```
    The `order_total` variable is initialized to zero. This will store the total cost of all the items added to the user's order.

4. **First Order Input**:
    ```python
    item_1 = input("Enter the name of item you want to order=")
    if item_1 in menu:
        order_total += menu[item_1]
        print(f"Your item {item_1} has been added to your order")
    else:
        print(f"Ordered item {item_1} is not available yet!")
    ```
    The user is prompted to enter the name of an item they want to order. If the item exists in the `menu` dictionary, its price is added to `order_total`, and a message is displayed confirming the addition. If the item is not available in the menu, the script informs the user.

5. **Prompting for Additional Orders**:
    ```python
    another_order = input("(Do you want to add another item? (Yes/No))")
    if another_order == "Yes":
        item_2 = input("Enter the name of the second item=")
        if item_2 in menu:
            order_total += menu[item_2]
            print(f"Item {item_2} has been added to order")
        else:
            print(f"Ordered item {item_2} is not available!")
    ```
    The user is asked if they want to order more items. If the response is "Yes," the user is prompted to enter the name of another item. Similar checks are performed to ensure the item exists in the menu, and the price is added to `order_total` if the item is valid.

6. **Display Total Amount**:
    ```python
    print(f"The total amount of items to pay is {order_total}")
    ```
    Once all orders are processed, the total price of the items is displayed.

7. **Final Message**:
    ```python
    print("Thank You Visit Again")
    ```
    A thank-you message is displayed to the user.

### Issues in the Code:
- **String Interpolation Error**: The code has a small mistake with the string interpolation in the print statements for the ordered items:
    ```python
    print("Your item {item_1} has been added to your order")
    ```
    should be written as:
    ```python
    print(f"Your item {item_1} has been added to your order")
    ```
    to correctly display the variable values.

- **Limited Number of Orders**: The code only handles two items (`item_1` and `item_2`). To improve the system, one could use a loop to handle multiple items dynamically.

### Improvements:
- **Error Handling**: The script can be improved with better error handling to check for invalid input (like misspelled item names).
- **Multiple Items**: Allowing users to add more than two items through a loop would make the system more flexible.
- **Clear Instructions**: The user interface could be made more user-friendly with better instructions for selecting items and making more orders.

### Example Output:

```
Welcome to HideOut Restaurant
Pizza: Rs40
Pasta: Rs35
Burger: Rs50
Salad: Rs25
Coffee: Rs30
Enter the name of item you want to order=Burger
Your item Burger has been added to your order
(Do you want to add another item? (Yes/No))Yes
Enter the name of the second item=Pasta
Item Pasta has been added to order
The total amount of items to pay is 85
Thank You Visit Again
```

This is a basic implementation of a restaurant ordering system, which can be further extended and optimized for practical use cases.
